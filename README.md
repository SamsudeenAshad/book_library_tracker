# Library Tracker

A Flutter project to track your book library.

## Introduction

This application allows you to keep track of the books you own, books you have read, and books you want to read. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing your personal library.

## Details and Features

-   **Add Books:** Easily add new books to your library by entering details such as title, author, and publication year.
-   **View Books:** Browse your library with a clear and organized list of all your books.

## Methodology

This project was built using Flutter, a cross-platform UI toolkit. It utilizes a simple data model to store book information and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the data. The application follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure maintainability and scalability.
